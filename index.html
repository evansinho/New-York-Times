              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved.
            </p>

            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
              the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
              realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <p id="bold-text">"As Big as It Gets"</p>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
              as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
              Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
              submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
            in 10 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
            not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.“With
            nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been
            lucky.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
            worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
            leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
            few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that
            night in 1979), in his office last week.
          </p>

          <p>
            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
            scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
            tended his radio telescopes.

            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described
            the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation,
            in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
            Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
            knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had
            ordered anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was
            a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I
            simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
            wrote in an email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
            was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way
            of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
            inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
            with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
            that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
            discoveries in the history of science.”
          </p>
          <p>
            John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
            and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
            pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
            beautiful and very convincing,” he said
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
            that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
            genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
            model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
            need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
            estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
            European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about
            the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
            Krauss said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
            will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams
            are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
            space.

            “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
            the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
            wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

              The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the
              faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe
              being wrenched violently apart at its birth.Credit...Steffen

            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
            radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
            preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
            gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
            one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
            twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
            said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
            little arrows going in spirals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
            differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
            telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

            “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent
            a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they
            had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to
            the breakthrough.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A Special Time</b><br />
            The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
            like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
            suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
            universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
            gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But
            they have long suspected that those are simply different
            manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in
            its earliest, hottest moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
            from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling
            out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
            after another splitting away.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was where Dr. Guth came in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
            temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
            point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
            state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with
            a mysterious latent energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a
            kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it
            was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
            created, the harder it pushed apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
            least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
            primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
            cosmic eye-blink.

            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
            least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
            primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a

          <p>
            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
            from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
            started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
            comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
            blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as
            the multiverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
            bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
            beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
            All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
            away, forever out of our view.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
            Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you
            wind up at inflation.”
