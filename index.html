            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so

              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved.
            </p>
           
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
              the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
              realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <p class="big-text">"As Big as It Gets"</p>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
              as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
              Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
              submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
